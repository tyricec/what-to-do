## Introduction

What Todo is a todo application that allows you to keep track of a todo list. Nothing more to it, but todo it.

## How To

### Add a todo

To add a todo item, type into the top text field and hit the enter key or press tab to add your first item. Very simple if I say so myself.

### Delete a todo

To delete a todo item, press the trash bin icon within the todo item.

### Edit a todo

To edit a todo, press the pencil square icon within the todo item. The todo text will become a text field that you can edit. After editing, press save to update the todo item with your edits.

### Check a todo

To signal that an todo item is complete, press the check icon within the todo item.
